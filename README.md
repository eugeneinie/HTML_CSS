# HTML_CSS
I created an ordered list with at least three items, including a nested unordered list within the second item, containing two items.
I buillt a table with three rows and three columns, and filled the cells with arbitrary text.
I also created a form that includes fields for a user's name, email, and submit button.
I explaied the difference between the <div> and <span> elements in HTML, and provided a use case for each element.
I added a CSS class to each section and used the class to change the background color of each section. I also used of pseudoclasses while targeting the classes so as to give them a unique background colour when the cursor hovers over them. I used external CSS to link up the codes.
I created a new repository for this assignment and submitted the link to my hosted address on GitHub.
